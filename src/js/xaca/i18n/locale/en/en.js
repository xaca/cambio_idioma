  "xaca_titulo":"Cielo's Beacon",
  "xaca_texto":"In a small village surrounded by mountains and crystal-clear rivers, lived a girl known to everyone as Cielo. Her nickname was not only due to her cheerful spirit and contagious laughter but also because of her precious, chubby cheeks that would blush under the sun. Though her black hair shone with a unique brilliance, Cielo often felt sad about the distance separating her from her beloved boyfriend, Andr√©s, who lived in a distant city. Every time the wind blew and the clouds drifted across the sky, Cielo felt alone, like a tortoise slowly making its way towards its destination, wishing that time and space would shorten.<br><br>Despite the distance, Andr√©s was always present in Cielo‚Äôs thoughts. Although sometimes his love showed through in affectionate scoldings, much like a tortoise carefully tending to its young, these moments only strengthened their bond. Andr√©s had a special talent for creating fun and endearing nicknames that made Cielo laugh, such as \"shooting star\" or \"smiling cloud,\" reminding her that, despite their separation, his love was a constant source of joy.<br><br>Over time, Cielo began to view the distance in a new light. Just as a tortoise, though moving slowly, always reaches its destination, Cielo understood that with each passing day, she was getting closer to reuniting with Andr√©s. Her sadness turned into hope, and her heart filled with renewed happiness. She knew that, even though miles apart, Andr√©s's love was the beacon illuminating her path, reminding her that she was never alone on her journey but always cherished and loved by someone deeply"
